Text Preview
\par}
The Text Preview window makes it easy to get an idea of how characters will work together in a font. You can change the magnification, screen size, and colors used. The Unicode Codepoints specified using the Character Editor are used for figuring out which glyph to show, which is particularly useful for fonts containing glyphs not in basic ASCII.\par
