Help files use the RTF format, because that's what the Forms API supports for text boxes.  They're hand-coded.

To add a new help topic, you need to do three things:
 - Add a new RTF for the help topic in the Help folder.
 - Select the RTF file, and change its Build Action from None to Embedded Resource.
    - If you don't do this, you'll get an error when you try to open the Help window.
 - Edit index.html to reference the RTF file you created.
    - If you don't maintain strict XML compliance, you'll get an error when you try to open the Help window.
