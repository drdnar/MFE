# MFE
Monochrome Font Editor

This is a pretty old project.
Despite the commit dates, it actually dates back even further to college.
I'm sure there's a lot I could have done better; I can't really explain it, but a lot of the design just feels awkward.
But I did have fun making the custom glyph editor widget.

# Usage

This is programmed as a stand-alone executable; just run the .exe.
It's a .NET project, and should run under Mono; if it doesn't, I consider that a bug.
When you run the program, under the help menu, there is an embedded readme.
Or I guess you can look in the Mfe/Help directory to read the files from outside the program.
